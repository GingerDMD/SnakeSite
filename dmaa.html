          Dimethylamylamine, DMAA for short, is a stimulant that used to be common in preworkout formulas, advertised as providing
          boundless energy and tunnel-like focus for strenuous gym sessions. DMAA came under fire a few years ago
          for being potentially hazardous to one's health, and a few deaths have been associated with the drug.
          But with as popular as the drug was in preworkout formulas for many years, a few deaths isn't particularly telling, as many
          more people have died from caffeine, a compound that's recognized as generally safe. <br><br>
          Anecdotal evidence from the Bodybuilding forums and other fitness communities
          suggests that DMAA can potentially lead to raised blood pressure and occasional ER visits in high doses, but provides laser-like focus in the gym
          when used responsibly. Nevertheless, those few deaths associated with the drug made for some bad PR, and as the FDA insists
          that DMAA cannot be found naturally in plants (heavily disputed by Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, who is currently in a legal battle with the FDA), they decided to place an outright ban on the stimulant,
          forbidding its sale as a supplement and demanding all preworkout manufacturers remove the product from their formulas.
          <br><br>
          DMAA is a bit difficult to come by these days, but a few preworkouts containing the compound
          can still be found with relative ease on Ebay and a few other sites. Centurion Labz' Rage and Juggernaut Nutrition's Irate preworkouts
          are two examples. Looking at the skeleton diagrams
          of amphetamine and DMAA, the similarities between the compounds is clear.

          DMAA kicks in quite quickly, and lasts for 1 - 3 hours in my experience. The tunnel vision is what most notably sets this compound apart
          from more conventional stimulants like caffeine, as there's this almost newfound ability to intensely focus on a single thing when on DMAA.
          Many users report a significant crash several hours after consumption of DMAA. In my experience, while the crash is certainly noticeable, it isn't
          as severe as many make it out to be. I simply feel drained and tired for a couple of hours after my DMAA-fueled workout.
          <br><br>
          DMAA is typically consumed at dosages between 25 - 75 mg. The original Jack3D had 25 mg per scoop, and Irate has 70 mg per scoop.
          DMAA does seem to build tolerance quite quickly, more quickly than DMHA in my experience, so it's best when used only a few times per week.
