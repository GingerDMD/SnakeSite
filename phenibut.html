          This GABA-b agonist is one of the most unique substances I've come across. Phenibut is a central nervous system
          depressant with anxiolytic and, at lower doses, stimulatory effects. It was developed by the Soviets for use with their
          cosmonaut program; they wanted a drug that would lower anxiety without impairing cognition, and this compound was the end result.
          Phenibut is unique in its long onset; effects typically don't appear until 2-3 hours after administration, though
          many users claim that a large dose of caffeine will cause it to kick in more quickly. It must be taken on an empty stomach, otherwise
          the user risks feeling nothing at all.
          <br><br>
          Phenibut today is sold online legally as a supplement. Many users compare the effects to those of a gregarious, less-impairing benzodiazepine,
          suitable for interviews or parties or any event where socialization is required. Music appreciation is often experienced by those with
          low tolerance, as is enhanced sleep and general stimulation. Imagine alcohol without the sloppiness or sleepiness and you've got
          a fairly accurate picture of what phenibut can do. It amazes me that this substance is so easily obtained online, but that's probably in part to its
          high tolerability. Even when taking more than an order of magnitude above what's required for threshold effects, it's rare for users of phenibut to find
          themselves in serious trouble. That is unless it's paired with another CNS depressant. Use of phenibut with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other GABA agonists
          is highly, highly, HIGHLY discouraged.
          <br><br>
          In my personal experience, phenibut is incredible for interviews, parties, and sleeping. Unlike alcohol, phenibut seems to actually <i>enhance</i> sleep rather than
          impair it. Tolerance to the compound unfortunately builds very quickly, and should only be used once a week MAX to continue to feel effects. I've learned this
          from experience. Dosage with this compound is variable, with many users experiencing the desired anxiolysis at 250 mg, while others typically dose in the 1.5 - 2 grams range.
          As phenibut is a GABA agonist that rapidly builds tolerance, physical addiction is very possible with daily use, and the reported withdrawal symptoms do not sound pleasant,
          so be smart about use. Phenibut is a powerful tool when used correctly, but some level of self-restraint is certainly required.
