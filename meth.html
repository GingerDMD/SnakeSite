          <h2><center>Background</center></h2>
          The infamous central nervous stimulant that stereotypically turns otherwise normal people into frothing,
          psychotic bandits.
          Apparently that methyl group attached the amine allows methamphetamine to cross the blood-brain barrier much
          more easily than regular amphetamine, allowing for a more intense (and addictive) rush. The route
          of administration certainly plays a role in the addictiveness of this compound as well; smoking or snorting
          methamphetamine allegedly causes a more intense but short-lived rush compared to oral administration, meaning
          the user is more likely to redose and become increasingly dependent.
          <br><br>

          <h2><center>Composition</center></h2>
          Methamphetamine contains a single chiral center, meaning that a racemic mixture of two enantiomers is generally synthesized,
          Dextromethamphetamine and Levomethamphetamine. The difference in effects between these two compounds is quite pronounced; Dextromethamphetamine (the S-isomer) is the very strong,
          neurotoxic CNS with such a fearsome repution, while Levomethamphetamine (the R-isomer) acts and is sold as a simple OTC nasal
          decongestant.

          <h2><center>How Methamphetamine directed the course of World War II</center></h2>
          Here's a bit of an interesting story. The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28, 1919, officially ending
          World War I with the Allied Powers coming out victorious. One of the stipulations
          of the treaty was that Germany was to
          lose their colonial possessions. This had many detrimental effects on the
          German economy, but also had indirect consequences on the country's productivity as a whole.
          <br>
          <br>
          Just as it is in the United States today, the majority of working
          Germans consumed some from of caffeine (a stimulant) on a daily basis, primarily through coffee.
          Coffee beans didn't grow well on native German soil, so they depended on their colonial possessions
          to import the plant. Naturally with the loss of German colonial possessions came a loss of the necessary
          quantity of caffeine to power the German workforce, so pharmaceutical companies lept at the opportunity
          to develop a new stimulant that could replace it.
          <br>
          <br>
          Enter Temmler, a very large pharmaceutical company at the time.
          Temmler didn't discover methamphetamine, but they <i>did</i> discover a new method of
          synthesizing it. If you're familiar with organic chemistry, the process may be of some
          interest to you: the birch reduction of ephedrine, the primary alkaloid in the
          <i>Ephedra sinica</i> plant, first removes the hydroxyl group in the benzylic position while also reducing the alkene that forms
          immediately thereafter, resulting in a racemic mixture of methamphetamine's enantiomers.
